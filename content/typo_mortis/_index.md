### Overview 

Typo Mortis a sinister little typing game. The idea came to me a few days before Halloween. I wanted to see if I could make a game on a tight deadline, so I decided to make Typo Mortis, on the condition that it be completed by end-of-day on October 31. I did manage to finish and publish on time (around 2pm on the day, with a fair amount of sleep deprivation).

Now I want to take it further. I think idea is a good one, and I intend to flesh it out into a complete game. 

### Development

I'm currently refactoring the spaghetti code I wrote to get the first version finished, and will begin expanding scope and features soon. 

I'm writing in C++, with Raylib. I have no intention to release source code, but I am exploring options for publication / distribution. For now, I will be regularily posting updates here, on my site. You can try the latest build now by clicking the link below.
