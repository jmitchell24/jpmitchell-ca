[ PARAGRAPH OF ITS ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO KEEP MOVING ]

### What is "The Thing?" 

I care a lot about the work that I do. I want to create things. I want my ideas to become real so that I and others can see and enjoy the results. 

I have also changed a lot. That's what happens when 'life' happens. I used to be a perfectionist with too many ideas and never-finished projects.
