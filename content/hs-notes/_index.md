Homescreen Notes is the first android app I created after graduating my program at Fanshawe College. 

Its a very simple note-taking app, made with a focus on minimalism and very 'low friction' use. 

A stand-out feature was the ability to write notes directly onto the app widget, saving the user from an additional context switch. 

Originally published in 2016, it has high user ratings and has been downloaded over <strong>10,000</strong> times. 

As of Summer 2025, I am currently working on a new, modernized version called "Hs Notes".
