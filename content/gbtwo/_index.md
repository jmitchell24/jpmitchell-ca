### Overview 

GBTWO is a Gameboy emulator. It has the capability to play many commercial games as well as many homebrew titles (demos included). The focus of this project is educational, but it also has some unique features. 

### Features 

- Multi platform: GBTWO is being developed for Linux, Windows, and the Web (via WASM, see demo).
- Extensive Debugging tools: Disassembler, Profiler, Memory and Register Visualization, and much more!

### Development

GBTWO is a project created by me, James Mitchell. I attempted many years ago to create a gameboy emulator, but that attempt was unsuccessful. Life circumstances provided me with the time to make a second attempt (hence, the name GBTWO). I consider this project wildly more successful, even in its current state. I plan to continue development for the forseeable future, and to maintain this WASM version for posterity here, on my personal site. 

I currently have no intention to release the source code, but I am offering this emulator completely free of charge.
