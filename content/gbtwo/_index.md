### Overview 

GBTWO is my second gameboy emulator. I tried to make one many years ago but never managed to get very far. 

GBTWO is a study of the Gameboy hardware, moreso than an useable emulator like [Gambatte](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Gambatte) or [BGB](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/BGB).
