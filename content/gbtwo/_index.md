### Overview

GBTWO is an exploratory Gameboy emulator. It has the capability to play many commercial games as well as many homebrew titles (demos included). The goal of the project was to learn the hardware of the Gameboy, moresoe than to create a means to play games. For that purpose emulators such as [Gambatte](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Gambatte) are much better suited. 

### Features

- Multi platform: GBTWO is being developed for Linux, Windows, and the Web (via WASM, see below).
- Extensive Debugging tools: Disassembler, Profiler, Memory and Register Visualisation, and much more!

### Development

GBTWO is a project that began in August 2025. I had attempted several years prior to create a Gameboy emulator, but I was ultimately unsuccessful. Life circumstances provided me with the time to make a second attempt (hence, the name GBTWO). I consider this project wildly more successful, even in its current state. I plan to continue development for the foreseeable future, and to maintain the WASM/Emscripten build for posterity here, on my personal site.

I currently have no intention to release the source code, but a build will always be freely accessible from this page.
