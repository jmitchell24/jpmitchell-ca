### Overview

Typo Mortis a sinister little typing game. The idea came to me a few days before Halloween. I wanted to see if I could make a game on a tight deadline, so I decided to make Typo Mortis, on the condition that it be completed by end-of-day on October 31. I did manage to finish and publish on time (around 2pm on the day, with a fair amount of sleep deprivation).

### Development

GBTWO is a project that I began in August 2025. I had attempted many years ago to create a Gameboy emulator, but I was ultimately unsuccessful. Life circumstances provided me with the time to make a second attempt (explains the name). I consider this project wildly more successful, even in its current state. I plan to continue development for the foreseeable future, and to maintain the WASM/Emscripten build for posterity here, on my personal site.

I don't intend to ever release the source code, but I will always keep the web build freely available on this page.
