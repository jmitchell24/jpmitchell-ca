### Overview 

A collection of common code I use in my personal projects. 
I've maintained this in some form since I was in high school. 
It is my [Perpetual Stew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_stew) of code, and it's very tasty!

### Features
- A complete string view implementation.
- Basic terminal utilities: escape sequences, raw mode, shell, etc...
- Various math utilities, for gamedev and graphics code.
- Many more misc. utilities...
