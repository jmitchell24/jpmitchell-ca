### Overview 

My personal website is a project that I have maintained in some form for over a decade. It has been an on-going effort that has changed a lot over many years. 

In its current iteration, it is my portfolio and blog. I rebuilt it from scratch in early 2025, with the goal of improving my web development skill. 

### Key Details
- Built from scratch, represents my current capability as a web designer. 
- Contains separate sections for my projects, blog posts, and links I want to share. 

### Development

I make full use of core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also use a static site generator, called [Zola.](https://www.getzola.org/) I intentionally did not use a template, work on this project began with a blank html file.
