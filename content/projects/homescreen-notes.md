### Overview 

A note-taking app for Android. Designed for simplicity and minimalism. It's key feature is the ability to take notes directly using a homescreen widget. 

### Development

Homescreen Notes is the first android app I created after graduating from my program at [Fanshawe College.](https://www.fanshawec.ca) I learned a lot about the Android operating system, mobile app development, and software publishing. 

The original release was in 2016, and the app has had over <strong>10,000</strong> downloads, and high user ratings.
