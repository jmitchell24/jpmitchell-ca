### Overview 

A powerful, minimalist file auto-namer.

### Features

- Rename multiple files at once
- Highly interactive terminal-based user interface
- Intuitive, and powerful name templating system

### Development

Rene is a project I began in Spring 2025. At that time I had not done a lot of recent C++ development and I wanted a small project to start writing code again. It also became an opportunity to learn about advanced terminal programming and what is possible using escape sequences. 

I used the [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI) TUI library, but I also wrote a lot of my own custom TUI code, and added a lot of it to my personal code library. [UT](https://github.com/jmitchell24/ut)
